## 须知
ok , maybe you are looking for it now .unfortunately, it may not work for you.
- 你需要自己更具你的路由器更改一下这个脚本.
- 如果你需要任何帮助,我很乐意和你讨论
- 拒绝未经许可,将其用于商业行为
- 没有任何担保
- 有任何问题,欢迎提issue

## 运行环境

- linux Mac Windows :请百度或google,`Drracket`,下载相应平台的`Drracket`安装包

## 现有功能
- 计算出账号
- 将账号密码交给路由器

## ToDo

- 心跳功能(你可以用mac先登录闪讯15分钟以上,就可以不用心跳包了(据说虚拟机也可以),或者伪装成mac的闪讯客户端)
- 适配不同的路由器(可能需要大家自己去改代码了)
